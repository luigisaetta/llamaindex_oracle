These recommendations are also for children who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19. For patients aged ≥18 years, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 .

      "COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines 98 Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Children With COVID-19 Last Updated: July 21, 2023 This section outlines the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s (the Panel) recommendations for the therapeutic management of children (i.e., pediatric patients aged <18 years) who are hospitalized for COVID-19. Throughout this section, the term “COVID-19” refers to the acute, primarily respiratory illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refers to the postinfectious inflammatory condition. Treatment Considerations for Children With COVID-19 Currently, no pediatric clinical trial results evaluating the treatment of COVID-19 have been published. Data evaluating pharmacologic therapy in children with COVID-19 are limited largely to descriptive reports.1,2 Therefore, more high-quality randomized trials, observational studies, and pharmacokinetic studies are urgently needed. Whenever possible, clinical trials of therapeutics and multicenter observational cohorts should enroll children with COVID-19. Published guidance documents on the treatment of COVID-19 in children have been mostly extrapolated from recommendations for adults with COVID-19, recommendations for children with other viral infections, and expert opinion.3-5 Applying adult data from COVID-19 trials to children is a unique challenge because most children experience a mild course of illness with COVID-19. Relative to adults, children with COVID-19 have substantially lower mortality and less need for hospitalization. Because of these differences in epidemiology and disease severity, the effect sizes for children are likely to be smaller than those observed in adults; therefore, to produce a beneficial outcome, the number needed to treat is higher. Collectively, these factors influence the risk versus benefit balance for pharmacologic therapies in children. Other challenges are the uncertainty about which comorbid conditions place children at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 and the uncertainty about the absolute magnitude of the increased risk from those comorbid conditions. For children with COVID-19, the number and severity of their comorbid conditions influence decisions about pharmacologic treatment. For more information on risk factors for children with COVID-19, see Special Considerations in Children . Recommendations In the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the Panel’s recommendations for the therapeutic management of hospitalized children are based largely on adult safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, the child’s risk of disease progression, and expert opinion (see Table 3c). For the Panel’s recommendations for adults, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 . In general, adult data are most applicable to older children with severe COVID-19 and predominantly lower respiratory tract disease. Extrapolation of adult data to children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with clinical syndromes common to other respiratory viruses (e.g., bronchiolitis, croup, asthma) is challenging. No evidence indicates that these syndromes should be managed differently when caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical judgment is needed when applying these recommendations to patients, particularly young children. Downloaded from on 1/4/2024 https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/\n",

Throughout this section, the term “COVID-19” refers to the acute, primarily respiratory illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refers to the postinfectious inflammatory condition. Treatment Considerations for Children With COVID-19 Currently, no pediatric clinical trial results evaluating the treatment of COVID-19 have been published. Data evaluating pharmacologic therapy in children with COVID-19 are limited largely to descriptive reports.1,2 Therefore, more high-quality randomized trials, observational studies, and pharmacokinetic studies are urgently needed. Whenever possible, clinical trials of therapeutics and multicenter observational cohorts should enroll children with COVID-19. Published guidance documents on the treatment of COVID-19 in children have been mostly extrapolated from recommendations for adults with COVID-19, recommendations for children with other viral infections, and expert opinion.3-5 Applying adult data from COVID-19 trials to children is a unique challenge because most children experience a mild course of illness with COVID-19. Relative to adults, children with COVID-19 have substantially lower mortality and less need for hospitalization. Because of these differences in epidemiology and disease severity, the effect sizes for children are likely to be smaller than those observed in adults; therefore, to produce a beneficial outcome, the number needed to treat is higher. Collectively, these factors influence the risk versus benefit balance for pharmacologic therapies in children. Other challenges are the uncertainty about which comorbid conditions place children at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 and the uncertainty about the absolute magnitude of the increased risk from those comorbid conditions. For children with COVID-19, the number and severity of their comorbid conditions influence decisions about pharmacologic treatment. For more information on risk factors for children with COVID-19, see Special Considerations in Children . Recommendations In the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the Panel’s recommendations for the therapeutic management of hospitalized children are based largely on adult safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, the child’s risk of disease progression, and expert opinion (see Table 3c). For the Panel’s recommendations for adults, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19 . In general, adult data are most applicable to older children with severe COVID-19 and predominantly lower respiratory tract disease. Extrapolation of adult data to children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with clinical syndromes common to other respiratory viruses (e.g., bronchiolitis, croup, asthma) is challenging. No evidence indicates that these syndromes should be managed differently when caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical judgment is needed when applying these recommendations to patients, particularly young children. Downloaded from on 1/4/2024 https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/',\n",

These recommendations are also for children who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19. For patients aged ≥18 years, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19 . Throughout this section, the term “COVID-19” refers to the acute, primarily respiratory illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Recommendations In the absence of sufficient clinical trial data on the treatment of children with COVID-19, the Panel’s recommendations for the therapeutic management of nonhospitalized children are based largely on adult safety and efficacy data from clinical trials (see Table 3a). No pediatric comparative studies have been published; therefore, all the quality of evidence ratings for the Panel’s recommendations in this section are based on expert opinion (i.e., a III rating). The majority of children with mild to moderate COVID-19 will not progress to more severe illness; therefore, the Panel recommends managing these patients with supportive care alone (AIII) .

However, the FDA has issued a statement concerning the accuracy of these home pulse oximeters, making this study endpoint less reliable. Interpretation •The use of metformin did not prevent the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of hypoxemia, ED visit, hospitalization, or death by Day 14. •Although the results of the prespecified secondary analyses of ED visits, hospitalization, or death by Day 14 and the secondary endpoint of hospitalization or death by Day 28 suggest a potential benefit of metformin, these results are not considered definitive.
