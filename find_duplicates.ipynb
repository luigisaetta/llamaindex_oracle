Triggering Fast-Start Failover Now that you have correctly configured fast-start failover, the following conditions can trigger a failover. •Database failure where all database instances are down •Datafiles taken offline because of I/O errors •Both the Observer and the standby database lose their network connection to the production database, and the standby database confirms that it is in a synchronized state •A user-configurable condition Optionally, you can specify the following conditions for which a fast-start failover can be invoked. It is recommend that you leave these user-configurable conditions at the default values and not invoke an automatic failover. •Datafile offline (write error) •Corrupted Dictionary •Corrupted Controlfile •Inaccessible Logfile •Stuck Archiver •ORA-240 (control file enqueue timeout) Should one of these conditions be detected, the observer fails over to the standby, and the primary shuts down, regardless of how FastStartFailoverPmyShutdown is set. Note that the for user-configurable conditions, the fast-start failover threshold is ignored and the failover proceeds immediately.

All other registered observers are considered to be backup observers. If the observer was not placed in the background then the observer is a continuously running process that is created when the START OBSERVER command is issued.
