JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data. A variety of programming languages can parse and generate JSON data. JSON commonly serves as a data-interchange language. It is often used for serializing structured data and exchanging it over a network, typically between a server and web applications. JSON is the dominant data format in web browsers that run applications written in HTML-embedded JavaScript. A JavaScript object is an associative array of zero or more pairs of property names and associated JSON values. A JSON object is a JavaScript object literal, which is written as a property list enclosed in braces, with name-value pairs separated by commas, and with the name and value of each pair separated by a colon.

In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. Also the XML “person” tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces. In general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer capabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it maps directly to some combination of dictionaries and lists. And since nearly all programming langua ges have something equivalent to Python’s dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very natural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data. JSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML. 13.5 Parsing JSON We construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries and lists as needed. In this example, we represent a list of users where each user is a set of key-value pairs (i.e., a dictionary). So we have a list of dictionaries. In the following program, we use the built-in json library to parse the JSON and read through the data. Compare this closely to the equivalent XML data and code above. The JSON has less detail, so we must know in advance that we are getting a list and that the list is of users and each user is a set of key-value pairs. The JSON is more succinct (an advantage) but also is less self-describing (a disadvantage). import json data =/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1 [ { \"id\" : \"001\", \"x\" : \"2\", \"name\" : \"Chuck\" } , { \"id\" : \"009\", \"x\" : \"7\", \"name\" : \"Brent\" } ]/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1 info =json.loads(data) print( /quotesingle.ts1User count:/quotesingle.ts1 , len(info)) for item ininfo: print( /quotesingle.ts1Name/quotesingle.ts1 , item[ /quotesingle.ts1name/quotesingle.ts1 ])\n"

      "\n",
      "1. JSON-Relational Duality: Developers can access and update JSON data as either JSON documents or relational tables, benefiting from the strengths of both.\n",
      "2. Operational Property Graphs in SQL: Developers can build real-time graph analysis applications against operational data directly in the Oracle Database, utilizing its industry-leading security, high availability, and performance capabilities.\n",
      "3. Microservice Support: Oracle Database 23c provides simplified cross-service transactions, making it easier to implement microservices.\n",
      "4. Lock-Free Column Value Reservations: Applications can reserve part of a value in a column without locking the row, allowing for more efficient operations on bank accounts, inventory, and other data.\n",
      "5. Native Database Support for JSON: Oracle Database supports JSON natively with features such as transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views, making it easier to work with JSON data in a relational database.\n",
