      "2 Application Development JSON JSON-Relational Duality JSON Relational Duality Views are fully updatable JSON views over relational data. Data is still stored in relational tables in a highly efficient normalized format but can be accessed by applications in the form of JSON documents. Duality views provide you with game-changing flexibility and simplicity by overcoming the historical challenges developers have faced when building applications using relational or document models. Related Resources View Documentation JSON Schema JSON Schema-based validation is allowed with the SQL condition IS JSON and with a PL/SQL utility function. A JSON schema is a JSON document that specifies allowed properties (field names) and the corresponding allowed data types, and whether they are optional or mandatory. By default, JSON data is schemaless, providing flexibility. However, you may want to ensure that your JSON data contains particular mandatory fixed structures and typing, besides other optional and flexible components, which can be done via JSON Schema validation.

Additionally, the performance of JSON and XML search indexes has been improved. Using the same syntax for XML or JSON search indexes and better performance increase productivity.

      "1 Introduction Oracle Database 23c is the next long term support release of Oracle Database. Oracle Database 23c, code named “App Simple,” accelerates Oracle's mission to make it simple to develop and run all data-driven applications. It's the sum of all the features from the Oracle Database 21c innovation release plus over 300 new features and enhancements. Key focus areas include JSON, graph, microservices, and developer productivity. Note: For information about desupported features, see Oracle Database Changes, Desupports, and Deprecations. JSON Relational Duality Data can be transparently accessed and updated as either JSON documents or relational tables. Developers benefit from the strengths of both, which are simpler and more powerful than Object Relational Mapping (ORM). See JSON-Relational Duality . Operational Property Graphs in SQL Developers can now build real-time graph analysis applications against operational data directly in the Oracle Database, utilizing its industry leading security, high availability and performance capabilities. See Support for the ISO/IEC SQL Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) Standard . Microservice Support Alongside Oracle’s already comprehensive support for microservices, new functionality makes it simpler to implement cross-service transactions. See Microservices . Lock-Free Column Value Reservations Lock-free column value reservations allow applications to reserve part of a value in a column without locking the row; for example, reserve part of a bank account balance or reserve an item in inventory without locking out all other operations on the bank account or item. See Lock-Free Reservations . 1-1\n",

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data.

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data. A variety of programming languages can parse and generate JSON data. JSON commonly serves as a data-interchange language. It is often used for serializing structured data and exchanging it over a network, typically between a server and web applications. JSON is the dominant data format in web browsers that run applications written in HTML-embedded JavaScript. A JavaScript object is an associative array of zero or more pairs of property names and associated JSON values. A JSON object is a JavaScript object literal, which is written as a property list enclosed in braces, with name-value pairs separated by commas, and with the name and value of each pair separated by a colon. An object property is sometimes called a key. An object property name-value pair is sometimes called an object member .Chapter 22 Topics for Database Developers 22-17\n",

In contrast, Oracle Database supports JSON natively with features such as transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views. You can access JSON data stored in the database the same way you access other database data, including using OCI, .NET, and JDBC. The preferred way to store JSON data is using the JSON data type, which is a proprietary binary format optimized for query and DML processing. You can use the JSON data type in most places where a SQL data type is allowed, including a column type or parameter type for a PL/SQL program unit. By using Oracle SQL, you can perform the operations such as the following on JSON data: •Join JSON data with non-JSON relational data. •Generate JSON document from relational data using SQL functions json_object and json_array . •Project JSON data into a relational format by using the SQL function json_table . •Create a check constraint with is_json to enforce JSON data in a column. The database uses the check constraint to confirm that the column is JSON for JSON-specific operations such as simplified syntax. •Manipulate JSON documents as PL/SQL objects. •Use SQL functions json_query and json_value to accept an Oracle JSON path expression as an argument and match it against the target JSON data. •Index JSON data. •Query JSON data stored in an external table. •Replicate tables with columns containing JSON data using Oracle GoldenGate.Chapter 22 Topics for Database Developers 22-19\n",
