      " Certainly! Oracle Database Release 23c includes several new features and enhancements for JSON support. Here are some of the key improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **JSON-Relational Duality Views**: Customers can now create fully updatable JSON views over relational data. This feature provides flexibility by allowing data to be accessed in the form of JSON documents while still being stored in highly efficient relational tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **JSON Schema Validation**: JSON Schema-based validation is now supported. Customers can define a JSON schema document that specifies the allowed properties and data types for their JSON data, ensuring consistent structures and data typing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistent XML and JSON Search Index Syntax**: The syntax for creating and using search indexes on XML and JSON data is now consistent, which simplifies productivity for developers working with both data formats. Additionally, the performance of JSON and XML search indexes has been improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Native Database Support for JSON**: Oracle Database continues to support JSON natively, offering features such as transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views. Customers can access JSON data stored in the database using various methods such as OCI, .NET, and JDBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **JSON Data Type**: The preferred way to store JSON data is still using the JSON data type, a proprietary binary format optimized for query and DML processing. It can be used in most places where a SQL data type is allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **SQL Functions for JSON**: Customers can leverage SQL functions such as `json_object` and `json_array` to generate JSON documents from relational data, and `json_table` to project JSON data into a relational format. Additionally, the `json_query` and `json_value` functions can now accept an Oracle JSON path expression as an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new features and enhancements demonstrate Oracle's ongoing commitment to improving JSON support in its database platform. \n",
      "\n",
