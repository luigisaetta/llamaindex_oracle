This section contains the following topics: •What Is JSON? •JSON and XML •Native Database Support for JSON •What Is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data. A variety of programming languages can parse and generate JSON data. •JSON and XML Both JSON and XML are commonly used as data-interchange languages. Unlike relational data, both JSON data and XML data can be stored, indexed, and queried in the database without any schema that defines the data. •Native Database Support for JSON JSON is widely stored in noSQL databases that lack relational database features. In contrast, Oracle Database supports JSON natively with features such as transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views. What Is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a language-independent, text-based data format that can represent objects, arrays, and scalar data. A variety of programming languages can parse and generate JSON data. JSON commonly serves as a data-interchange language. It is often used for serializing structured data and exchanging it over a network, typically between a server and web applications. JSON is the dominant data format in web browsers that run applications written in HTML-embedded JavaScript. A JavaScript object is an associative array of zero or more pairs of property names and associated JSON values. A JSON object is a JavaScript object literal, which is written as a property list enclosed in braces, with name-value pairs separated by commas, and with the name and value of each pair separated by a colon. An object property is sometimes called a key. An object property name-value pair is sometimes called an object member .Chapter 22 Topics for Database Developers 22-17\n",

      "Question: What is JSON Relational Duality in Oracle Database 23c? Explain with details\n",
      "JSON Relational Duality is a feature in Oracle Database 23c that allows developers to access and update data in both JSON documents and relational tables. This capability is particularly useful for those who want to work with data in a flexible schema format while still being able to enforce stricter data structures when necessary. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "With JSON Relational Duality, you can store your data in highly efficient relational tables while simultaneously presenting a JSON document view of the same data to applications. This is particularly beneficial for scenarios where you might have applications that require JSON documents to interact with other services or systems, while the underlying data is best stored and managed in a relational manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duality views, which are fully updatable JSON views over relational data, enable this functionality. These views present the data as JSON documents, simplifying development for applications that require JSON data. At the same time, the data is stored efficiently in relational tables, taking advantage of the power and performance of the relational database engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have used Oracle Database before, you may be aware that JSON data is typically schemaless, providing flexibility in how you store and access data. However, with JSON Schema validation, you can enforce specific data structures and data types on your JSON data. This ensures that while you enjoy the flexibility of JSON, you can also ensure that certain aspects of your data adhere to predefined constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using JSON Relational Duality, you can unlock a new level of flexibility and simplicity in application development. You can take advantage of the strengths of both the relational and document models, without being constrained by them. This flexibility is particularly valuable in today's landscape, where applications often need to interact with various data sources and APIs, and compatibility is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're interested in exploring more about JSON Relational Duality, the provided PDF mentions relevant resources you can refer to for further details and documentation. \n",
